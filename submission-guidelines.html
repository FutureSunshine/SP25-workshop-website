    <!-- Instructions for Paper Submission Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions for Paper Submission</h2>
        <p>All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Anonymous Submission Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Anonymous Submission</h2>
        <p>Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper.</p>
        <p>While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission.</p>
        <p>The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

    <!-- Conflicts of Interest Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Conflicts of Interest</h2>
        <p>During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds:</p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper.</li>
            <li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years.
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years.</li>
            <li>The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
            <li>The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
            <li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.</p>

    <!-- Research Ethics Committee Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Research Ethics Committee</h2>
        <p>Similar to 2024, IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review the Menlo Report for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.</p>

    <!-- Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days <a href="https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy" target="_blank">CERT disclosure policy</a> to 90 days <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html" target="_blank">Google Project Zero</a> ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.</p>
        <p>Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.</p>
        <p>The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Submitted papers should not include full CVE identifiers in order to preserve the anonymity of the submission.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research</h2>
        <p>Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:</p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.</li>
            <li>Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.</li>
            <li>If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.</p>

    <!-- Financial and Non-financial Competing Interests Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Financial and Non-financial Competing Interests</h2>
        <p>In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, “Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,” or “Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis.” More information regarding this policy is available here.</p>

    <!-- Page Limit and Formatting Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Page Limit and Formatting (Important Changes)</h2>
        <p>Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix. The final camera-ready paper must be no more than 18 pages, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed. Reviewers are not required to read appendices.</p>
        <p>Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates must use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass[conference,compsoc]\{IEEEtran\}}.). See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences” Overleaf template for an example. We are not aware of an MS Word template that matches this style.</p>
        <p>Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template (including using the non-compsoc IEEE conference template), modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review. Authors are responsible for verifying the paper format (e.g., compare with the above linked Overleaf template). While HotCRP provides some automated checking, the checks are limited. Note that some LaTeX packages (e.g., \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage\{usenix\}}) override the compsoc formatting and must be removed.</p>

    <!-- Conference Submission Server Section -->
    <section class="content-section gradient-card small-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">Conference Submission Server</h2>
        <p>Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers.</p>
        <p>Submission servers:</p>
